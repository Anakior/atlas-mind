# Licenses of the vendored assets (web/vendor/)

Inventory of the bundled third-party libraries and fonts, with their version and
license. The license banners of the minified files are preserved as-is; this file
supplements the ones that were missing upstream (MiniSearch served without a
banner by jsDelivr, mammoth shipped without a banner, .woff2 fonts with no
accompanying OFL text).
